# Sandali Hewapathirana - Analyst Portfolio
## About
I am Sandali, a graduate with a degree in Information Technology, specializing in Information System Engineering, and I have achieved a GPA of 3.01. Over the past year, I have gained valuable experience working as a trainee internal auditor at Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. Additionally, I have interned as a manual quality assurance engineer and as a business analyst at Rapdiventure Business Solutions Company. 

The world is changing rapidly, and while I may not have extensive professional experience, I am confident in my ability to bring a fresh perspective and an innovative approach to every project. I am open-minded and adept at quickly learning new concepts and skills.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Business Aanlysis Projects
#### Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
**Code:** [`Potato Harvest Prediction SRS document.pdf`](https://github.com/SandaliHewapathirana/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Potato%20Harvest%20Prediction%20SRS%20document.pdf)

**Goal:**
Help potato farmers to increase their harvest and the profit by providing a mobile application platform for the farmers to manage their tasks related to the potato harvesting properly.

**Description:** 
most of the farmers have a low literacy level. Hence, this system has been developed using a flow which can be followed easily also for the users who do not have a higher literacy level. So, “Potato harvest prediction system”, has been built for the use of potato farmers as potato farmers.This potato harvest prediction system is a new, self-contained product. The product has been developed for the farmers who cultivate potatoes.

The software assists the farmers with predicting how much of harvest can be expected according to the date of the plantation and the amount planted and the harvesting date. And also, the software assists with the prediction of whether condition, temperature, humidity and rainfall with the use of IoT, prediction of potato diseases and pest infections and also provides with best market suggestions.

Through following link you can access our user interface designs ['User Interfaces'](https://www.figma.com/design/kQnmgH56Hn3I8w4OQ7gdZ6/Solution-2?node-id=0-1).

**Skills:** Documentation, Problem Solving, UI, User Stories, Use case diagram, Activity Diagram.

**Technology:** Figma, UML.

Excel
#### Bike Sale Dashboard

**Goal:** I
dentify the ideal customer for a bike shop. To accomplish this, we will analyze customer data from an Excel sheet containing information on Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, and Purchased Bike.

**Code:** [`Bike Sale Dashboard.xlsx`](https://github.com/SandaliHewapathirana/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Bike%20Sale%20Dashboard.xlsx)

**Setup:**
To start the project, data cleaning was performed to ensure accurate analysis. This included the removal of duplicate entries to avoid potential biases in the dataset. Furthermore, the data was updated to be more interpretable, such as replacing "m" and "f" with "male" and "female", and "m" and "s" with "married" and "single". Age groups were also created to facilitate better visualization of the data. Additionally, I ensured there was no missing data and that each field had the correct data type.

Business Questions:
What is the most common age group of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common gender of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common income range of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common education level of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common occupation of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common region of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common commute distance of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
Does the marital status of customers have any correlation with the likelihood of purchasing a bike from the shop?

**Data exploration**
I used the customer data to create pivot tables that grouped the customers based on different criteria. Using these groups, I created charts that show key insights. Additionally, differnt functions were used to perform calculations.

To make it easy to view all this information at once, I created a dashboard that displays all the charts. I also added a slicer to the dashboard, which allows users to filter the data based on different criteria. This makes it easy to identify the customer segments that are most likely to purchase a bike.

Below figure show the Bike Sale Dashboard.

**Conclusion:** 
The largest group of bike purchasers is aged 31-50. Most have partial high school education and work in management. North America is the leading region for bike sales, with purchasers typically commuting 0-1 mile. They usually own 0-1 cars and do not have children. Married customers are more likely to buy bikes, likely due to higher combined incomes, while home ownership does not significantly impact bike purchasing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Excel.

### Power BI
#### Product Sale Dashboard

**Goal**
The Product Sales Analytics Dashboard project entails analyzing a company's sales data and indicating profit by product, sales, and other significant factors that might influence the company's performance.

**Code:** [`Product Sale Dashboard.pbix`](https://github.com/SandaliHewapathirana/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Product%20Sale%20Dashboard.pbix)

**Description:** 
The dataset includes information about sales informations in the company products. It contains various attributes such as the products, segment, countries , education, number of units sold, manufacturing price, sale price, discount, cost of good sale, profit, the years and months that products are sold.

**Dashoboard Design**
With the processed data, I created a Product Sales analytics dashboard that presents key insights on below questions,

Which month and year had the most profit?
Where is the company seeing the most success (by country/region)?
Which product and segment should the company continue to invest in?

These visualizations can help decision-making and keep track of their sales.
